# IGDrivSim: A Benchmark for the Imitation Gap in Autonomous Driving üöó

This repository provides the code and experiments for **IGDrivSim**, a benchmark built on top of the [Waymax](https://github.com/waymo-research/waymax.git) simulator, designed to investigate the **imitation gap** in learning autonomous driving policies from human expert demonstrations.

## Key Features
- **Imitation Gap Study**: Examines how discrepancies between human perception and self-driving sensors affect learning.
- **Benchmark Tasks**: Simulated driving tasks with full observability, noisy data, and restricted fields of view.
- **Baselines**: Includes evaluation of behavioral cloning and a combination of behavioral cloning with reinforcement learning (PPO) trained with Jax on Waymax.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IGDrivSim.git
   cd IGDrivSim

2. Installation
a. Configure access to Waymo Open Motion Dataset

A simple way to configure access via command line is the following:

- Apply for Waymo Open Dataset access.
- Install gcloud CLI.
- Run the following commands:
    ```bash
    gcloud auth login <your_email> # with the same email used for step 1.
    gcloud auth application-default login

b. Install Required Packages:

- With **Docker**: Create a Docker image and build a container using the provided Dockerfile.

- With pip:
    ```bash
    cd docker
    pip install -r requierements.txt
    python -m pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html

Please refer to [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) for specific instructions on how to setup JAX with GPU/CUDA support if needed.

## Run experiments üîÑ

The experiment configurations are located in scripts/config. To reproduce the results, run.

To reproduce the results run:
   ```bash
   python scripts/train_bc_rl.py -w_bc 1. -w_rl 0. -conf CircularMasking --radius 4

## Visualize Partial Observability üìä

To visualize the different partial observability modes in IGDrivSim, open the notebook:
   ```bash
   notebook limited_obs.ipynb
